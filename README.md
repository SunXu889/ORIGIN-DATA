Species Distribution Modeling under Climate Change Scenarios
MaxEnt Outputs for Current and Future Climate Projections

Repository Contents
This repository contains geographic distribution projections generated using MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Modeling) for a target species under multiple climate scenarios. Data are structured as follows:

1. Current Climate Conditions
Model outputs derived from contemporary climate baseline data.

2. Future Climate Projections
SSP1-2.6 (Low Radiative Forcing Scenario)

Mid-21st Century: 2041–2060 ("2050s")

Late-21st Century: 2061–2080 ("2070s")

SSP3-7.0 (Medium-High Radiative Forcing Scenario)

Mid-21st Century: 2041–2060 ("2050s")

Late-21st Century: 2061–2080 ("2070s")
